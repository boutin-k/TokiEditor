# TokiEditor

TokiEditor is a tool developed to quickly create maps for 2D game named Toki.
Developed via the Qt 5.15.2 framework from the MDI base.

The application is composed of :

* A left dock containing the tiles of the map (ranged by category).
* A central zone used to display the levels edited.

Each level is stored in a binary file containing:

* The path of the tiles file
* The path of the egg sprite to catch
* The path of the shoebox file
* The path of the music file
* The number of special actions
* The dimension of the level
* The level map

> The editor is developed through Ubuntu and has been tested on Windows 10.

The game is also available [here](https://github.com/boutin-k/Toki).
